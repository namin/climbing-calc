# climbing-calc

A calculator whose class of admissible total functions **grows
verifiably** under proposer/gate control. Each climb admits either a
new operator (certified to terminate under an admitted schema) or a
new schema (a well-founded relation, certified well-founded). The
class of admissible operators strictly grows across the climb.

Climber re-rendered with computation as the substrate. Same kernel
discipline, different substrate, headline crosses a *computational*
unreachable line: Ackermann is not admissible under structural
recursion alone, but admits after the `lex2` schema is installed.

See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) for the design rationale and decisions.

## Status

Builds clean on `leanprover/lean4:v4.29.1`. Zero `sorry`s. Smoke
executable demonstrates the climb scene by scene.

climbing-calc — the calculator that climbs
================================================================

Scene 1: T_bare — empty theory
  schemas: []
  operators: []

Scene 2: T₀ — install structural schema
  schemas: [structural]
  operators: []

Scene 3: T₁ — admit PR operators under structural
  operators: [fib, fact, exp, mul, add, double, pred]
  pred([7]): (some 6)
  double([7]): (some 14)
  add([2, 3]): (some 5)
  mul([3, 4]): (some 12)
  exp([2, 5]): (some 32)
  fact([5]): (some 120)

Scene 4: T₂ — install lex2 schema
  schemas: [lex2, structural]

Scene 5: T_climbed — admit ackermann and sudan under lex2
  operators: [sudan, ackermann, fib, fact, exp, mul, add, double, pred]
  ackermann([3, 3]): (some 61)
  sudan([1, 1, 2]): (some 8)
  sudan([2, 1, 1]): (some 8)

Scene 6: refusal — wrong arity / unknown operator
  ackermann([1]): none
  sudan([1, 1]): none

Scene 7: the line crossed
  ackermann([3, 7]): (some 1021)

## The pattern

| Role | Instance |
|---|---|
| Substrate | A theory `T = (schemas, operators)`; operators are total `List Nat → Nat` functions |
| Proposer | Human or LLM offering an operator or schema with its certificate |
| Gate | Lean's kernel: `Schema` requires `WellFounded`; `Operator` requires a total `fn` |

The kernel-checked invariants live in the Lean types themselves. A
`Schema` value cannot exist without a constructive `WellFounded` proof;
an `Operator` value cannot exist without a Lean-typed total function.
`Theory.installSchema` requires a `SchemaAdmissible` proof (name
fresh); `Theory.installOp` requires `OperatorAdmissible` (declared
schema present *and* operator name fresh). Bogus admissions — claiming
a schema that hasn't been installed, or shadowing an existing operator
— are rejected at admission time.

**Honest scoping.** What v1 does *not* enforce is the structural
coupling between an operator's `fn` and its declared schema's
relation. An `Operator` carries `fn : List Nat → Nat` as opaque Lean
data, and Lean's type checker accepts any total function regardless
of which schema name appears on the record. The bound between "I
declared `schema := "lex2"`" and "my recursion actually decreases
under lex2" lives at the level of code review and Lean's elaborator
choosing a measure for the underlying function definition — not the
calculator's gate. Closing that gap is v2: an embedded operator
language with structural termination certificates per recursive call.
See [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).

## The climb

| Theory | Schemas admitted | Operators admitted |
|---|---|---|
| `T_bare`    | —                | —                                                       |
| `T₀`        | structural       | —                                                       |
| `T₁`        | structural       | pred, double, add, mul, exp, fact, fib                  |
| `T₂`        | structural, lex2 | pred, double, add, mul, exp, fact, fib                  |
| `T_climbed` | structural, lex2 | pred, double, add, mul, exp, fact, fib, ackermann, sudan |

Each transition is one `installSchema` or `installOp` call. The
recursions `A(n+1, m+1) = A(n, A(n+1, m))` and Sudan's
`F_{n+1}(x, y+1) = F_n(F_{n+1}(x, y), F_{n+1}(x, y) + y + 1)` call back
into themselves with the *same* first argument — no single coordinate
decreases. The `lex2` schema (lexicographic order on `Nat × Nat`) is
the new well-foundedness needed to admit them; once `lex2` is in the
theory, Lean's elaborator accepts both via the standard `termination_by`
machinery.

**The refusal witness.** `Demo.lean` carries a commented-out
`badAckImpl` that's exactly Ackermann's shape but asks Lean to admit
it under a structural measure on the first argument alone. The build
fails on uncommenting; this is the "without the gate" world made
visible at compile time.

## What's in scope (v1) vs out

**In scope (this version):**
- Two schemas: structural and lex2.
- Four operators: add, mul, exp, ackermann.
- Static demos via `lake exe smoke`.

**Out of scope (future):**
- Goodstein's function (ε₀ recursion, crosses the PA-provable-totality line).
- LLM proposer cascade (Bedrock-mediated, climber-style).
- Mechanical proof that operators under `structural` form a proper
  subclass of total functions (Ackermann-not-PR as a Lean theorem).
- Higher-arity schemas, dependent recursion.

## Why this is the keynote example

The original Smith/Black tower's `(em (set! base-apply ...))` modifies
the evaluator; the headline is "checking caught up with reflection."
`climbing-calc`'s analogue: the proposer modifies the *theory of
admissible functions*; the kernel checks via Lean's typing discipline;
the climb crosses a line the starting theory cannot reach. The
"impossible before" use case is a calculator that genuinely extends
what it can compute in place, with a kernel-checked totality invariant
preserved across every rung.
